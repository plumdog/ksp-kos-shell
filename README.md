Because everything, including space, is more fun when you can automate it

# Overview

Intended to be the full contents of a `Script/` folder, located at `Kerbal Space Program/Ships/Script`. (Note that the `Kerbal Space Program` folder is the one that contains things like `GameData/`, `KSP_Data/`, `saves/`.)

Once added, and [KOS](https://github.com/KSP-KOS/KOS) is installed, a KOS CPU will let you choose `boot.ks` while in the VAB. Then when you take your rocket to the launchpad, it will open the KOS terminal and prompt you to choose from its functions.
